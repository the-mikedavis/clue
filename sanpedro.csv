And it isn’t hard to understand why. The spectacular house was built between 1936 and 1938 over a small waterfall in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. It served as a summer retreat of Edgar J. Kaufmann and his family until 1963 when it was bestowed to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy which shortly thereafter opened it to the public.","25.76168,-80.19179","location"
